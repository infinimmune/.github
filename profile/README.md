> _“I don’t feel I’m a very creative scientist. I wish I could be more creative. But if you force me to think about it… I can come up with 3 simple concepts:_
> 
> _1. You have to be very curious about something._
> 
> _2. You have to have an unfailing urge to address the question you have._
> 
> _3. I think it helps to try to combine knowledge in at least two different fields where people don’t necessarily interact._ 
> _Those are the three things that come to me as the way to be a little more creative.”_
